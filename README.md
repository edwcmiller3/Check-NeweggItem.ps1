Wrote this script when the NVIDIA 1080 and 1070 graphics cards were released. I had just built a new gaming PC and kept missing out on a GPU as they were sold out as soon as any stock became available. This script would run indefinitely and alert on screen and via SMS that the card I was watching came in stock, with a link to directly add to cart. 

The Gigabyte G1 Gaming 1080 in my PC is proof that it did work!
